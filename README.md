# Data Science and Machine Learning Repository

## Description
This repositury contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks related to Data Science and Machine Learning. With Hands-on experience in various real-world datasets and problems, these notebooks reflect a practical approach to Data Science.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing
* Data, Datatypes and Variables
* Central Tendency and Dispersion
* 5 point summary and skewness of data
* Box-plot, covariance and Coeff of Correlation
* Univariate and Multivariate Analysis
* Encoding Categorical Data
* Scaling and Normalization
* Imputing missing values
* Working with Outliers

#### Followed A 6 Step Framework for Approaching Machine Learning Projects:
1. `Problem definition` — What business problem are we trying to solve? How can it be phrased as a machine learning problem?
2. `Data` — If machine learning is getting insights out of data, what data we have? How does it match the problem definition? Is our data structured or unstructured? Static or streaming?
3. `Evaluation `— What defines success? Is a 95% accurate machine learning model good enough?
4. `Features `— What parts of our data are we going to use for our model? How can what we already know influence this?
5. `Modelling `— Which model should you choose? How can you improve it? How do you compare it with other models?
6. `Experimentation `— What else could we try? Does our deployed model do as we expected? How do the other steps change based on what we’ve found?
